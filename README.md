  - GPA: 3.64
  - Minors: Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics
  - Honors and Awards: Dean's List Spring 2022 - Spring 2023

- **Northern Virginia Community College** - 9 Credit Hours Completed (June 2022 - December 2022)
  - GPA: 4.0

## 💼 Research Experience
- **Undergraduate Research Assistant** at Hume Center for National Security and Technology (September 2022 - May 2023)
  - Utilized Solidity and Hardhat to deploy and test a novel blockchain security technique.
  - Proofread and edited the paper that motivates and describes the new security approach.
  - Assisted in creating a smart contract homework assignment for graduate students in a blockchain-focused class.

## 📝 Publications
- **Privatizing the Volume and Timing of Transactions for Blockchain Applications** (ICCCN 2023)
  - [Read Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230098)
  - [Repo](https://github.com/trevormil/privatizing-blockchain-timestamps)
  - VTBC proposes a blockchain system for safeguarding volume and timing data in multi-party applications by using decoy transactions that appear real but don't impact application execution. This preserves privacy without altering the blockchain's structure, maintaining integrity and verifiability. Implemented on a private Ethereum network via a Dutch auction, the system's performance was evaluated.
