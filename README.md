## 📝 Publications
- **Privatizing the Volume and Timing of Transactions for Blockchain Applications** (ICCCN 2023)
  - [Read Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230098)
  - [Repo](https://github.com/trevormil/privatizing-blockchain-timestamps)
  - VTBC proposes a blockchain system for safeguarding volume and timing data in multi-party applications by using decoy transactions that appear real but don't impact application execution. This preserves privacy without altering the blockchain's structure, maintaining integrity and verifiability. Implemented on a private Ethereum network via a Dutch auction, the system's performance was evaluated.
